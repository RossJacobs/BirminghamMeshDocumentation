After sending changes to the device, always re-check: (we've seen these change for some reason)
	Frequency Slot: 20 (confirm this)
	Frequency: 906.875 Mhz (confirm this)

Save off your public and private keys to another location immediately after applying them.
	Good options are things like password safe, or bitwarden 

After flashing a new firmware on a node, do a factory reset, then configure settings and add channels.
